## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-First Workflow


### What I learned
- I thought 5 hours was enough, sadly it was not. I need to improve my understanding regarding HTML and CSS first, so that I don't have to worry about the design of the website and the responsiveness. I also learned and impleted the scroll designs.
